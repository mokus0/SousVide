This is a work in progress.  It's the software part of a project of mine to build a sous vide water bath on a $10 budget by using parts I already had (or could beg or borrow from friends).  It's purely a personal project and I don't promise any kind of support or maintenance for it, but if you find the code useful feel free to tinker with it.

It's completely unpolished and I explicitly disclaim all warrantees, express or implied, including any implied warrantee that might be construed as a promise that running this code won't burn your house down.
